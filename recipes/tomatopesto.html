    <h1>Sicilian Tomato Pesto</h1>

        <p1>I'm excited to share my version of pasta alla Trapanese, featuring Sicily's amazing tomato pesto. <br> 
            I love the green Genovese-style pesto, but when super-sweet cherry tomatoes are in season, I really believe this is the best pesto.</p1><br><br>

        <p2>Whenever we visit my wife, Michele’s, parents, my father-in-law, Al, always passes along a few local, Sacramento area magazines he’s saved for us. <br>
            They’re usually recipes or food articles he thinks I may be interested in. In fact, sometimes he’ll do something people almost never do these days: <br>
            He’ll actually walk to the post office and mail us the piece to read. Yes, just like before the Internet. </p2>

        <p3>We had lunch recently and he passed along a magazine with a feature on heirloom tomatoes. <br>
            I read and enjoyed the article, but only skimmed the serving suggestions that were interspersed throughout. <br>
            Luckily, Michele was paying much closer attention, and pointed out a picture of Pasta alla Trapanese, a dish I hadn’t yet posted on the channel. </p3>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup whole roasted almonds</li>\
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup packed fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>4 mint leaves (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound red cherry tomatoes or red grape tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 pound busiate pasta, or other curly shaped pasta, such as fusilli</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring about 2 cups of water to a boil, remove from the heat, and stir in almonds; let sit for 3 to 4 minutes. <br>
                Drain, and once cool enough to handle, rub skins off with your hands; alternately, transfer drained almonds to a kitchen towel, <br>
                then fold up the towel and rub almonds until skins come off. </li><br>

            <li>Crush sliced garlic with kosher salt in a mortar and pestle into a smooth paste. <br>
                Alternately, place garlic on a board and sprinkle kosher salt on top; use the flat side of the knife to flatten, mash, <br>
                and scrape the garlic and salt mixture until it is a smooth paste.</li><br>
            
            <li>Add peeled almonds to the jar of a blender, followed by the cheese, basil, mint, garlic paste, oil, and tomatoes. <br>
                Add the ingredients in this order, so that the almonds and cheese have a chance to grind before the wetter ingredients mix in.</li><br>
            
            <li>Begin to pulse blender on and off until almonds and cheese are ground, then continue to pulse until remaining ingredients are incorporated. <br>
                Blend on high until the pesto is as coarse or smooth as you like. </li><br>
            
            <li>Taste for salt, and adjust. Set aside while pasta is cooking. </li><br>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook busiate pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. <br>
                Transfer pasta into a bowl with a strainer. Reserve starchy cooking liquid. </li><br>
            
            <li>Add about 1/3 cup of the pasta water into the bowl, and then transfer in the pesto, along with a large pinch of salt, and toss to coat. <br>
                More pasta water can be added to adjust the texture. Once mixed, add another optional handful of cheese, and toss one last time. Serve immediately.</li>

        </ol>
